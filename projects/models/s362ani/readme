1-D MODELS:

STW105 - our new reference model, also known as REF

PREM750_CARDS - the PREM model

---------------

3-D MODELS:

S362ANI - our preferred global model of shear-wave velocity. In this model,
          radial anisotropy is confined to the uppermost mantle (that is,
          since the anisotropy is parameterized with only the four uppermost 
          splines, it becomes very small below a depth of 250 km,
          and vanishes at 410 km). The 1-D reference model is STW105.

S362WMANI - a version of S362ANI with anisotropy allowed throughout the mantle.

S362ANI_PREM - a version of S362ANI calculated using PREM as the 
               1-D reference model.

S362ANI_OLDCRCOR - a version of S362ANI calculated using linear Woodhouse & Dziewonski (1984)
                   crustal corrections and STW105.

S2.9EA - a global model with higher resolution in the upper mantle beneath 
         Eurasia calculated using STW105 as the 1-D reference model.

S2.9EA_OLDCRCOR - a version of S2.9EA calculated using linear Woodhouse & Dziewonski (1984)
                  crustal corrections and STW105.

COMPILATION

Use the Makefile in the 'src' directory. All programs are
written in Fortran 77 and have been tested on Solaris, Mac OS,
and Cygwin (GNU). Note, that, in order to make the compilation
on Mac OS and GNU easy, in the 'Makefile', I used a single
precision version of a subroutine 'splcon' (defined in
'splconsngl.f'). It is sufficiently accurate for most
applications, such as plotting the model etc. However,
the models have been derived using a double precision version
of 'splcon' (defined in 'splcondble.f') on Solaris, which is
compiler dependent. This subroutine is also included in 'src'. 
If you have any questions/comments/suggestions regarding
compilation, please let me know.

PLOTTING VELOCITY and ANISOTROPY USING A REGULAR GRID OF POINTS

The 'velani_global.e' script shows how to evaluate global models
at a given depth and plot them using GMT plotting tools.

The 'velani_eurasia.e' script shows how to evaluate the model
of Eurasia at a given depth and plot it using GMT.
The boundary of the high-resolution part of the model is defined 
in 'BEURA.bound', which is embedded on the figure.

Both scripts use the program 'velani', 
which evaluates vsh, vsv, Voigt average, and vsh-vsv. 
The output is in km/s, if 'absolute' is selected, 
or in per cent, if 'relative' is selected.
(The vsh and vsv evaluations are relative to vsh and vsv
in the reference model, respectively.
Both the Voigt-average and vsh-vsv evaluations are relative
to the Voigt average in the reference model.)

'velani' evaluates the velocity and anisotropy only within a selected
rectangular region of interest at points separated by the specified 
'pixel size'.

If requested, the average calculated within the entire region of interest
is removed.

PLOTTING TOPOGRAPHY

The script 'topo.e' shows how to plot the topography of the 410-km and 650-km 
discontinuities. The script uses the program 'topo'. 
The topography is defined in the model as depressions in km.

---------------

SUBROUTINES EVALUATING ALL PARAMETERS AT A GIVEN POINT

The program 'bin/test_subshsv.exe' demonstrates how to call a subroutine 'subshsv',
which returns perturbations in vsh,vsv,vph,vpv,eta, and density
w.r.t. STW105 at a given colatitude, longitude, and radius; 
and a subroutine 'subtopo', which returns depth perturbations of
the transition zone discontinuities.
