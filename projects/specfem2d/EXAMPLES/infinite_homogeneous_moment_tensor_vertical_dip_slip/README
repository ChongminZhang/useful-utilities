Example designed by Zhinan Xie, Harbin, China:

adds an example to show that the code is ready and accurate for seismic simulation with a moment-tensor source.

The analytical line source solution is obtained by integrating the analytical point source solutions
(available in Aki and Richards, Quantitative Seismology, 2nd edition Eq.(4.29)) along the y-direction,
using numerical integration based on the natural definition of integration.

Zhinan also converted the 2D line source solution to a point source solution for an infinite homogeneous model.
To do so he followed the work done in:

Dunzhu Li, Don Helmberger, Robert W. Clayton and Daoyuan Sun,
Global synthetic seismograms using a 2-D finite-difference method

and:

Thomas Forbriger, Lisa Groos and Martin Schafer,
Line-source simulation for shallow-seismic data. Part 1: theoretical background.
