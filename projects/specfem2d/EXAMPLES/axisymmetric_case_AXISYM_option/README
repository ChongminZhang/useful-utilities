This example contains an example of the use of AXISYM option. This option allows for axisymmetric simulations. The domain defined
is physically the meridional 2D shape of a axisymmetric 3D domain.

This example is defined by three files : _Par_file_axisym -> contains all the parameters of the run + receivers positions
                                         _interfaces_axisym -> contains the geometry
                                         _SOURCE_axisym -> contains the informations about the source

To run the example, type:

  ./run_this_example.sh

in this directory.

Then see the results in OUTPUT_FILES/. The seismograms created can be compared with those in REFERENCE_SEISMOS.

This script is designed for serial and parallel simulations. If specfem2d has been built correctly (with --with-mpi option) 
just change the number of processes in Par_file_axisym.

To clean this directory : rm -rf DATA/ OUTPUT_FILES/ plot_points_per_wavelength_histogram.gnu points_per_wavelength_histogram_* x* *~
