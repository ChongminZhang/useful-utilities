1. modify interpolate.f90
   mainly to change the location/names of your SEP/SU models

2. run interpolation:
	./interpolate.bash

3. then the model will be saved in "DATA/model_velocity.dat_input"
   you can then run simulations in that model by setting in "DATA/Par_file"
	assign_external_model           = .true.
	READ_EXTERNAL_SEP_FILE          = .true.

   a simple example can be done by:
	./run.bash
