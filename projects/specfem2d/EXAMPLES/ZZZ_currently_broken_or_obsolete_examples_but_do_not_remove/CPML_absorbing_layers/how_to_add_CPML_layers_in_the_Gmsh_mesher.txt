To add PML absorbing layers to a mesh / model created with the "Gmsh" mesher, one needs to perform
an extrusion from the lines that correspond to the outer edges of the model.
In this directory you will find a simple example showing how to do this with a square.

(Something similar is probably needed / feasible in the CUBIT mesher)
